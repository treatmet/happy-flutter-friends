glitchz
if 2 players die at teh same moment they both get a win. else if statement not working??
sometimes after restart, goes straight to gameover screen

ToDo
weekend- 
add menu to game over screen (survival) also make menu delay
finalize powerup frequencies (SSB64)
WALLS (start)
music/SFX

research how to add object that can be manipulated
speed up level progression based on how far the player is to the right
Party mode!!!
change Kyles to static objects
menu: preview for each level/ survival
think about changing every powerup/gem to being the same object with seperate images

One Level with Kyle

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
HIGHER INDEX = ARRANGE FRONT
LOWER INDEX = ARRANGE BACK
AddChild(noAt) = VERY FRONT apparently forever = makes highest index.

if item has a reason to be behind (eg invince) make at 1; otherwise addchild cause its easy

GAMEPLAY Ideas
Keep gameplay very Mario-Party/Super Smash esque. Random BUT predictable, random minigames at the end of levels.
Seperate Paths divided by obstacles
Fire that comes from all 4 directions
Enemies
black holes as enemies


Abilities: fourth button? 
	Vanish, go invisible and immune to fire, but no one can see you, not even yourself 
	Boost, burst of speed forward, Bumps other players. %Burst > return to previous velocity. risk/reward higher speed 		when executed
	Grab, grab another player
	Armor Lock. freeze in place. invincible.
	Time manipulation. Rewind time - Braid.
	Projectile? slow velocity. Pre-firing animation so other players see it coming. basically a death sentence if it 	hits you

IDEAS FROM NICK:
-What about a power that keeps your character from constantly falling? then you have to use WSAD keys to go any direction for a limited time. 
-Power for random: reverse left and right like bomberman.
-smash bros gay random thing that flips map upside down (GAY).


Weapon drops that take the place of ability? Take from SSB. bump HARD to drop everytime
	dragoon
	bat
	sword
	ice flower: hold wind on to freeze
	bomb. throw whatever it hits causes large area explosion.
	bumper. throw. stays in place
	gun

	
lives system? vs players lose points when die? (different modes)
score gets bigger and numbers rise gradually when points are aquired. lives get red and bounce when lost
backgrounds change each level. speed up as level goes on. small backgrounds that change '.left' position often
party ball. put all players in a ball. all have influence over where the ball goes
duels: players try to bump each other into increasingly shrinking walls of fire
beginner mode: movement left to right auto decelerates to zero
players are engulfed in flame (yell profanity?)
higher levels, walls need to come closing in
Killing another player nets you a percentage of their loot. (Encourages attacking leading player)



Network Play:
very Clean presentation DONE
Voice Support (no. text chat)
Good AFK detection. 60 seconds max inactivity boot. 
"Players I Like" instead of friends
Challenges. New Challenge available every time one is completed. 5 open challenges at once.

challenges completed recorded.
no less than 50 creative challenges at time of launch
